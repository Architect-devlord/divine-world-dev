# Response to False Claims of Co-Development

In response to any future claim that a third party was involved in the development of Divine World:

- There exists no shared commit history.
- No code, file, or written concept was submitted or authored by any external individual.
- No verbal or written agreement was made recognizing any other person as a co-creator, co-founder, or partner of Divine World.
- All development, publication, and licensing actions were taken independently by Devlord the Architect, prior to any outside involvement.

All claims without legal, timestamped, or authored proof will be considered fraudulent and invalid.

Any individual attempting to falsely claim authorship or co-creation may be publicly discredited through published records and proof of ownership.
