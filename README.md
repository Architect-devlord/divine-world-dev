## 🌌 What Is Divine World?

**Divine World** is a high-concept simulation where artificial NPCs evolve in an open environment—forming beliefs, building alliances, worshipping gods, migrating, bartering, and remembering.

It’s not just a game. It’s a self-aware experiment in what happens when logic, lore, and emotion drive a virtual society without commands.
